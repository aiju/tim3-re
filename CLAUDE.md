# Ghidra Reverse Engineering Conventions

## Binary Info

- **Game:** The Incredible Machine 3 (Windows, Sierra Entertainment)
- **Platform:** Win32s (Win32 subset running on Windows 3.1 — cooperative multitasking)
- **Compiler:** Borland C (not C++ — hand-rolled polymorphism, no vtables in objects, all __cdecl)
- **Types:** No native `bool` — boolean functions return `int` (0/1). Use `int` not `bool` in prototypes.
- **SEH:** `_sehSetup` at top of many functions is Borland's structured exception handling boilerplate — ignore it

## Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** `fooBar` camelCase (avoids clashing with Win32 PascalCase like `GetPrivateProfileStringA`)
- **Globals:** `g_fooBar`
- **Local variables/parameters:** `snake_case`
- **libc functions:** Use standard names (`strcpy`, `strrchr`, `strcmp`, etc.)
- **CRT/compiler-generated functions:** Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_crtExit`, `_runStaticDestructors`)
- **Uncertain names:** Suffix with `_MAYBE` when evidence is suggestive but not conclusive (e.g., `g_hasCustomGravity_MAYBE`)
- **Duplicate functions:** Suffix with `_DUP` when Borland C emitted identical code at two addresses (e.g., `getHandleUserData_DUP`)

## Workflow

- Use Ghidra MCP to decompile and rename functions/variables/globals
- When exploring a function, recursively dig into subfunctions before naming — understand the full context first
- Name things confidently when the evidence is clear; flag uncertainty when guessing
- Call out string-smelling DAT_ addresses for the user to press `A` on in Ghidra (we lack a set-data-type API)
- For arrays/buffers (e.g., `char[20]`), ask the user to define the data type in Ghidra first — `rename_data` won't stick on undefined bytes. Once typed, the rename works and the `&` prefix disappears in decompiled output
- Rename parameters and locals alongside functions — don't leave param_1/param_2 behind
- To set parameter names and types, use `set_function_prototype` — but omit the calling convention (e.g., `__cdecl`), as a Ghidra bug causes it to be treated as part of the name
- **`__fastcall` misdetection:** Ghidra sometimes marks functions as `__fastcall` when ECX/EDX values leak through from callers. In this codebase everything is `__cdecl`. Symptoms: unused `param_1`/`param_2` in ECX/EDX, `extraout_ECX`/`extraout_EDX` noise, `in_stack_` references after prototype change. Fix: user must manually change calling convention to `__cdecl` in Ghidra's function editor before setting the prototype via API
- Prefer specific names over generic ones (e.g., `showSierraLogo` over `playIntro`)
- **Custom structs:** Provide C-style struct definitions for the user to enter in Ghidra's Data Type Manager, then apply via `set_function_prototype` or data typing. Verify field names resolve correctly in decompiled output after applying

## Matched Decompilation

Recompiled C source lives in `src/`. The goal is to produce .obj files whose code is byte-identical to the original binary.

### Workflow

1. **Decompile** the target function via Ghidra MCP (`decompile_function`)
2. **Get original disassembly** via Ghidra MCP (`disassemble_function`) — this is the ground truth
3. **Write a rough first draft** in `src/` — don't overthink it, just clean up the decompilation into readable C and compile it. Seeing what the compiler actually produces is more useful than theorizing about codegen
4. **Compile** with `make` (runs `./bcc` — Borland C 4.5 via Wine)
5. **Compare disassembly** — use `obj-extract/target/debug/obj-extract disasm --compact --with-symbols symbols.jsonl src/foo.obj symbol` to get output in the same format as Ghidra, then compare. Without `--compact`, the output includes hex bytes and uses a more detailed layout, useful for inspecting encodings
6. **Iterate** — adjust the C source until disassembly matches
7. **Sync Ghidra names** — rename globals/functions/data in Ghidra to match names chosen in the C source

### Codegen Pitfalls

Things that affect whether Borland C 4.5 output matches the original:

- **Expression nesting vs. temp variables** — `strcpy(strrchr(buf, '\\'), NULL)` as one expression causes the compiler to pre-push args across calls; splitting into `p = strrchr(...); strcpy(p, NULL);` changes push ordering
- **Globals vs. locals/parameters** — e.g., `GetModuleFileNameA(g_instance, ...)` re-reads from the global, while `GetModuleFileNameA(hInstance, ...)` uses a register
- **Precomputed flags** — `can_evict = (flags & 2) != 0` produces SETNZ+AND; testing `flags & 2` inline each iteration produces different code
- **Variable declaration order** can affect register allocation
- **Borland libc quirks** — e.g., `strcpy` is NULL-safe (writes `'\0'` to dst if src is NULL)
- **`while` with comma operator** — `while (c = *p, c != '\0' && c != ' ')` generates a boolean intermediate (XOR/MOV/TEST). Use `while ((c = *p) != '\0' && c != ' ')` instead for clean short-circuit jumps matching the original
- **Register allocation mismatch** — our Borland C 4.5 sometimes picks different variables for ESI/EDI than the original binary (e.g., putting `argc` in ESI when the original has it on the stack with `i` in ESI). Tried `volatile`, `register`, declaration reordering, `-r-`, pragma options — nothing fixes it. Might be a slightly wrong compiler version or unknown compiler flags. This cascades to which registers hold pointers (EAX vs EDX) and character temps (DL vs AL). Structural code still matches

### Symbol Names

- `__cdecl` functions get a `_` prefix in the object file (e.g., `gameAlloc` → `_gameAlloc`)
- `__stdcall` functions have no prefix (e.g., `WinMain` → `WinMain`)

## Documentation

- **doc.md** — accumulated reverse engineering notes (architecture, structs, subsystem docs). Consult when exploring unfamiliar code areas. These are best-effort guesses from ongoing RE work, not authoritative — always verify against the actual binary before relying on them.

## res-extract Tool

- CLI tool at `res-extract/target/debug/res-extract`, extracts files from RESOURCE.MAP archives
- `res-extract ls` / `res-extract ls -l` — list files (default game dir: `./TIM3/TIMWIN`)
- `res-extract cat <file> ...` — dump file contents to stdout
- `res-extract extract <file> ...` — extract to disk
- `res-extract -d <game_dir> ...` — override game directory
- Part name lookup: `res-extract cat INFO.RES | sed -n '$((id+1))p'` (e.g., id 7 → `sed -n '8p'` → Pulley)
